Example 2-13: Set Stroke Attributes
===================================

		The strokeJoin() function changes the way lines are joined
		(how the corners look), and the strokeCap() function changes
		how lines are drawn at their beginning and end:
		

				function setup() {
					createCanvas(480, 120);
					strokeWeight(12);
				}
				
				function draw() {
					background(204);
					strokeJoin(ROUND);			// Round the stroke corners
					rect(40, 25, 70, 70);		
					strokeJoin(BEVEL);			// Bevel the stroke corners
					rect(140, 25, 70, 70);
					strokeCap(SQUARE);			// Square the line endings
					line(270, 25, 340, 95);
					strokeCap(ROUND);			// Round the line endings
					line(350, 25, 420, 95);
				}

		
		
		
		
		The placement of shapes like rect() and ellipse() are con-
		trolled with the rectMode() and ellipseMode() functions. Check
		the p5.js Reference to see examples of how to place rectangles
		from their center (rather than their upper-left corner), or to
		draw ellipses from their upper-left corner like rectangles.
		When any of these attributes are set, all shapes drawn afterward
		are affected. For instance, in Example 3-12 on page 28, notice
		how the second and third circles both have the same stroke
		weight, even though the weight is set only once before both are
		drawn.



		Notice that the strokeWeight(12) line appears in setup() instead
		of in draw(). This is because it doesnâ€™t change at all in our pro-
		gram, so we can just set it once and for all in setup(). This is
		more for organization; placing the line in draw() would have the
		same visual effect.
