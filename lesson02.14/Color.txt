Color
=====

All the shapes so far have been filled white with black outlines.
To change this, use the fill() and stroke() functions. The val-
ues of the parameters range from 0 to 255, where 255 is white,
128 is medium gray, and 0 is black. Figure 3-3 shows how the
values from 0 to 255 map to different gray levels. The back
ground() function weâ€™ve seen in previous examples works in the
same way, except rather than setting the fill or stroke color for
drawing, it sets the background color of the canvas.
