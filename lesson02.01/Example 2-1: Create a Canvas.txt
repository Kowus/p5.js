Example 2-1: Create a Canvas
============================

The canvas is created and images are drawn inside through
code elements called functions. Functions are the basic building
blocks of a p5.js program. The behavior of a function is defined
by its parameters. For example, almost every p5.js program has
a createCanvas() function that creates a drawing canvas with a
specific width and height. If your program doesn’t have a create
Canvas() function, a canvas with dimensions 100×100 pixels is
created.

The createCanvas() function has two parameters; the first sets
the width of the drawing canvas, and the second sets the height.
To draw a canvas that is 800 pixels wide and 600 pixels high,
type:
function setup() {
createCanvas(800, 600);
}
