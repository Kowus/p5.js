Example 2-16: Draw with Color
=============================

To move beyond grayscale values, you use three parameters to
specify the red, green, and blue components of a color. Because
this book is printed in black and white, youâ€™ll see only gray val-
ues here. Run the code to reveal the colors:

        function setup() {
            createCanvas(480, 120);
            noStroke();
        }
        function draw() {
            background(0, 26, 51);
            fill(255, 0, 0);
            ellipse(132, 82, 200, 200);
            fill(0, 255, 0);
            ellipse(228, -16, 200, 200);
            fill(0, 0, 255);
            ellipse(268, 118, 200, 200);
        }

The colors in the example are referred to as RGB color, which is
how computers define colors on the screen. The three numbers
stand for the values of red, green, and blue, and they range from
0 to 255 the way that the gray values do. These three numbers
are the parameters for your background(), fill(), and stroke()
functions.
