Example 2-9: Use angleMode
==========================

Alternatively, you can convert your entire sketch to use degrees
instead of radians using the angleMode() function. This changes
all functions that accept or return angles to use degrees or radi-
ans based on which parameter is passed in, instead of you
needing to convert them. The following example is the same as
Example 3-8 on page 24, but it uses the angleMode(DEGREES)
function to define the start and stop values in degrees:

		function setup() {
			createCanvas(480, 120);
			angleMode(DEGREES);
		}
		function draw() {
			background(204);
			arc(90, 60, 80, 80, 0, 90);
			arc(190, 60, 80, 80, 0, 270);
			arc(290, 60, 80, 80, 180, 450);
			arc(390, 60, 80, 80, 45, 225);
		}

Drawing Order
=============

When a program runs, the computer starts at the top and reads
each line of code until it reaches the last line and then stops.
