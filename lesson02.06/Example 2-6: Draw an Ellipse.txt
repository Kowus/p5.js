Example 2-6: Draw an Ellipse
The x and y coordinates for a rectangle are the upper-left corner,
but for an ellipse they are the center of the shape. In this exam-
ple, notice that the y coordinate for the first ellipse is outside the
canvas. Objects can be drawn partially (or entirely) out of the
canvas without an error:

function setup() {
	createCanvas(480, 120);
}

function draw() {
	background(204);
	ellipse(278, -100, 400, 400);
	ellipse(120, 100, 110, 110);
	ellipse(412, 60, 18, 18);
}
p5.js doesnâ€™t have separate functions to make squares and cir-
cles. To make these shapes, use the same value for the width
and the height parameters for ellipse() and rect().
