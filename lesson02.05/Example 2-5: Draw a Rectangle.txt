Example 2-5: Draw a Rectangle
Rectangles and ellipses are both defined with four parameters:
the first and second are the x and y coordinates of the anchor
point, the third for the width, and the fourth for the height. To
make a rectangle at coordinate (180, 60) with a width of 220
pixels and height of 40, use the rect() function like this:

function setup() {
	createCanvas(480, 120);
}
function draw() {
	background(204);
	rect(180, 60, 220, 40);
}
