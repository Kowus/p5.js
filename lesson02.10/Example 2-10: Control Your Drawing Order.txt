Example 2-10: Control Your Drawing Order
========================================

Drawing Order
=============

When a program runs, the computer starts at the top and reads
each line of code until it reaches the last line and then stops.

If you want a shape to be drawn on top of all other shapes, it
needs to follow the others in the code.


		function setup() {
		createCanvas(480, 120);
		}
		function draw() {
		background(204);
		ellipse(140, 0, 190, 190);
		// The rectangle draws on top of the ellipse
		// because it comes after in the code
		rect(160, 30, 260, 20);
		}


Modify by reversing the order of rect() and ellipse() to see the
circle on top of the rectangle:


		function setup() {
			createCanvas(480, 120);
		}
		function draw() {
			background(204);
			rect(160, 30, 260, 20);
			// The ellipse draws on top of the rectangle
			// because it comes after in the code
			ellipse(140, 0, 190, 190);
		}


You can think of it like painting with a brush or making a collage.
The last element that you add is whatâ€™s visible on top.
