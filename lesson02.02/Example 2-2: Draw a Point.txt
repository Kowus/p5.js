Example 2-2: Draw a Point
To set the color of a single pixel within the canvas, we use the
point() function. It has two parameters that define a position:
the x coordinate followed by the y coordinate. To create a small
canvas and a point at the center of it, coordinate (240, 60),
type:

function setup() {
	createCanvas(480, 120);
}
function draw() {
	background(204);
	point(240, 60);
}


Try to write a program that puts a point at each corner of the
drawing canvas and one in the center. Then take a stab at plac-
ing points side by side to make horizontal, vertical, and diagonal
lines.
