Example 3-7: Draw Part of an Ellipse
The arc() function draws a piece of an ellipse:

		function setup() {
			createCanvas(480, 120);
		}
		function draw() {
			background(204);
			arc(90, 60, 80, 80, 0, HALF_PI);
			arc(190, 60, 80, 80, 0, PI+HALF_PI);
			arc(290, 60, 80, 80, PI, TWO_PI+HALF_PI);
			arc(390, 60, 80, 80, QUARTER_PI, PI+QUARTER_PI);
		}

The first and second parameters set the location, while the third
and fourth set the width and height. The fifth parameter sets the
angle to start the arc and the sixth sets the angle to stop. The
angles are set in radians, rather than degrees. Radians are angle
measurements based on the value of pi (3.14159). Figure 3-2
shows how the two relate. As featured in this example, four
radian values are used so frequently that special names for
them were added as a part of p5.js. The values PI, QUARTER_PI,
HALF_PI, and TWO_PI can be used to replace the radian values for
180째, 45째, 90째, and 360째.


Radians and degrees are two ways to measure an
angle. Degrees move around the circle from 0 to 360, while radi-
ans measure the angles in relation to pi, from 0 to approximately
